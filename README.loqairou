This is "Loq Airou", a sort of 3D sketching tool for the Verse network
platform.

Loq Airou was written by Eskil Steenberg.

The Verse homepage is at <http://www.blender.org/modules/verse/>, and the
project page at Blender, where you can find out how to access the code in
CVS, is at <http://projects.blender.org/projects/verse/>.

The full manual, by Eskil, is available in the docs/loq-airou/ directory,
in HTML format.

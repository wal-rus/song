This directory contains some "resources", which are used to add icon graphics
into the executables, when built in Windows.

The way this works is like this:

1) Each supported executable has a file named PROG.rc, which specifies the
   resources used by that program. These are one-liners, that simply define
   a single ICON-type resource.
2) The resource points to a graphics file in the ICO file format, of which
   there are also one per executable.
3) The .rc files are run through a resource compiler, which generates the
   PROG.res files.
4) Each executable is linked with its corresponding PROG.res file to create
   a final PROG.exe, which will then (magically, heh) have the proper icon.

The provided Makefile.win32 specifies the above, and relies on nmake knowing
that RES files are built by the "rc.exe" compiler (part of the Platform SDK).

Enjoy.

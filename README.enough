Enough is a library to help you write Verse applications. It layers between
the "RAW" Verse API and your application code, and acts as a data-storage
system, storing all Verse data in custom data structures.

Enough was written by Eskil Steenberg.

The below sketch roughly illustrates the relationship between your appli-
cation, the Enough library, and the Verse API. Note how reads are served
from the Enough library, while writes (data transmission) must be done
directly with the Verse API. This is a central fact about the Enough
library: it acts as a data storage system only, and does not deal at all
with sending data to the Verse host.

For more information about how to work with the Enough library, please see the
"enough.h" header file, or the "Quel Solaar", "Connector", "UV Editor" and
"Loq Airou" applications. These serve as the primary "official" users of the
library.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
"Connector" is a Verse application that lets you view and modify Verse data
using a schematic view. You can create, delete and modify all Verse nodes,
it includes built-in editors for the material node as well as for the curve
node.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Connector has a special interface that is somewhat different from other
applications, but it has been designed to be easy to use (at least easier
than my other apps).
</p>

<h3>Connecting</h3>
<p>
Once you have started Connector you will see a short animated intro. At any
time you can click anywhere in the window to display the connection
interface. Once there, you can either click on "localhost", to connect to the
localhost, or you can type in the address of a non-local host (IP address or
DNS name) and name and password if needed.

The Connection Interface

<h3>Switching Modes</h3>
<p>
Ones you have connected you find yourself viewing a white desktop. This
is where you can arrange your nodes and view their links. At the moment it
is empty because you need to select what nodes you want to work with. In
order to access this you must go to the node list. Click in empty space to
switch to the node list screen. Now some nodes will appear. To get out of a
node simply click in empty space in the node list to return to desktop.
</p>

<h3>Node List</h3>
<p>
In the node list all nodes on the host are visible in rows from top to
bottom. The nodes are visualized as circles that look like different
planets. Each node type is visualized as a different type of planet.
For instance object nodes are visualized as suns, and geometry nodes are
Saturn-like planets with rings surrounding them.

 <p>
  The Node List
 </p>
</div>
<p>By clicking on one of the nodes, you return to the desktop but now the node is available on the desktop. In each node you can also read the name
of the node. The top row of nodes shows nodes labeled "NEW", and does not actually show real nodes, but if you click on one of them you will create
new node of the relevant type, and place it on the desktop. If you have nodes that won't all fit on the screen at once, scroll the list up or down by
simply clicking and dragging the background. So note that there is a difference between clicking on the background (to return to desktop) and
dragging the background (to scroll). By clicking on a node in the node list using the middle mouse button you display it on the desktop without
actually returning to the desktop.
</p>

<h3>The Desktop</h3>
<p>
Once you return to the desktop you can rearrange your nodes by clicking
and dragging them. You can also scroll the desktop by clicking and dragging
it. If you grab the desktop at the far left or right edge of the window, you
can zoom in and out.

              <TD VALIGN = "TOP" WIDTH="30%"> Most applications say that success 
                is in numbers but we believe that features and functions should 
                come from an artists needs and not the needs of a sales department. 
                Each feature should be carefully thought out and justified and 
                be just right. Too many applications have features that would 
                be used if they didn't have that little flaw making them unreliable. 
              <TD>
              <TD VALIGN = "TOP" WIDTH="30%"> We believe in building workflow 
                for the user, the user should come into an environment that is 
                so perfect that it makes them more creative and more productive. 
                The tool should not be visible, the art should be, time should 
                be spent rearranging art not the application. 
              <TD>
              <TD VALIGN = "TOP" WIDTH="30%"> The things we build don't look 
                like others. In every moment we try to be rebels, changing, challenging, 
                disputing and hopefully one day revolutionizing. </TD>

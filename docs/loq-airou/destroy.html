                <P> To Delete edges or control polygons simply press the Left 
                  mouse button in space and drag a line that crosses the edges 
                  you want to delete. Make sure that the edge ends don't snap 
                  to any existing vertexes. Delete only works on polygons facing 
                  the camera and will not delete the surfaces turned away from 
                  the view. When you are drawing an edge that deletes another 
                  edge a red making appears on the edge. Make sure you see the 
                  red marks when you want to delete and that you don't see them 
                  when you want to draw an edge or do a selection. </P>

                Notice the red overlay drawn over the edges you cross the edges. 
                They indicate that if the left mouse button is released the edges 
                and the surfaces will be deleted. Therefore you must
                look out for this symbol so that you don't delete geometry by 
                accident when drawing or selecting. </TD>
              <TD VALIGN = "TOP" WIDTH="30%"> When an edge or surface is deleted 
                it turns to dust, this is a good indicator that a delete has been 
                made and gives the user a chance to undo the action if it was 
                not intended. <img border="0" src="./post_del.png"> </TD>

                <P> Sometimes some functions are applied to polygons and not to 
                  vertexes. In these cases the application will consider them 
                  selected only if all vertexes used by that polygon are at least 
                  0.01 selected. Selected polygons appear slightly brighter so 
                  they are easy to see. This unification of polygon and face select 
                  removes the need to switch between two different modes when 
                  modeling and allows the user to use the same tools for all types 
                  of select. </P>
                <P> When a vertex is even 0.01 selected a manipulator appears. 
                  A manipulator is a gizmo that gives you access to some basic 
                  ways of manipulating the selection like Move, Rotate and Scale. 
                  The full capabilities of the manipulator will be explained later. 
                <P>

                <P> Since Subdivision surface modeling is very much like polygon 
                  modeling you can turn of the SDS surface and only display the 
                  cage and then you have turned Loq Airou in to a Polygon modeler. 
                  It has been designed to be a SDS modeler with very detailed 
                  control so it may not be useful for high polygon counts but 
                  should be perfect for low poly counts, like game arts. </P>

                <P> To modify already existing geometry we use selections. Selections 
                  allow us to choose a specific part of an object and then apply 
                  an action to it , like move it, rotate it, or scale it. The 
                  selection is per vertex and can be considered a number between 
                  zero and one, where zero is not selected and one is fully selected. 
                  But you can also have a vertex with a selection value of 0.5. 
                  This means that 50% is selected and that if possible actions 
                  will only be applied 50% to this vertex. This is very useful 
                  when you want to modify large parts of a model in a smooth way 
                  and it gives you the abillity to modify the model as if it were 
                  clay.</P>

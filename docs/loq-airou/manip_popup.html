The manipulator popup contains:
</P>
<LI>Reverse</LI>
<LI>Duplitcate</LI>
<LI>Detach</LI>
                <LI>Collapse</LI>
<LI>Full crease</LI>
<LI>No crease</LI>
<LI>Flip</LI>
<LI>Smooth Selection</LI>
<LI>Delete</LI>
                <P> "Reverse", makes all non selected vertexes selected and all 
                  selected vertexes unselected. (all soft selection goes threw 
                  the formula: new_selection = 1 - old_selection) This functionality 
                  is very useful because you can now un select portion by using 
                  Inverse Select. Select some vertexes and the inverse the selection 
                  again. </P>
</TD><TD VALIGN = "TOP" WIDTH="30%">
                <P> "Duplicate", duplicates all selected polygons and selects 
                  the new surface. When using this action make shore you use the 
                  manipulator to move the new surface away form its position before 
                  clearing the selection, otherwise you will end up with two surfaces 
                  in the same place that can make it hard to separate them. </P>
                <P> "Detach", detaches all selected polygons in to a separate 
                  entity. </P>
                <P> "Collapse", collapses all vertexes in to one. That will delete 
                  some polygons of reshape some quads in to triangles. If the 
                  single vertex created by the collapse isn't used by any polygon 
                  it will be deleted. A Detach followed by a collapse can be used 
                  to delete selected polygons. </P>
<P>
"Full crease", makes all selected edges creased. 
</P>
<P>
"No crease", makes all selected edges uncreased. 
</P>
</TD><TD VALIGN = "TOP" WIDTH="30%">
                <P> "Flip", turns all faces to face the opposite direction. All 
                  non selected polygons that shares a edge with a selected polygon 
                  will be destroyed since a single edge can not have two polygons 
                  facing different directions. </P>
                <P> "Smooth Selection", makes the vertexes selected borders semi 
                  selected and expands the selection to make surrounding vertexes 
                  some what selected too. This Action can be applied multiple 
                  times to get an even smoother selection. It is a very useful 
                  function since it turns the transform manipulator in to a deformer 
                  style tool. </P>
                <P> "Delete", deletes all selected polygons. It is a useful 
                  alternative to the standard delete tool since it allows you to 
                  select large pieces of geometry and delete them quickly. </P>

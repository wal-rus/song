                <P> By clicking outside the arcs but still inside the outer circle 
                  you activate the scale function. The scale is by default in 
                  3 dimensions but by drawing along one of the three axises you 
                  can limit it to one axis. Right Button snapping works here as 
                  well, and it snaps to the outer edge of the selection. This 
                  is very useful when you want to scale a selection to fit in 
                  side a room. </P>
                <P> On the right side you of the manipulator you will find two 
                  handles, they are used to move the normal and the tangent direction 
                  of the surface. 
                <P>

The lower one moves the selections in the normal direction, this means in and 
                out. The normals are computed by averaging the surrounding polygons 
                normals for creating a correct normal. If a vertex is used by one 
                of more selected polygons its normal will not be influenced by 
                any polygons that are not selected. 
                <p></P>

                <P> The top handle is the tangent handle. It allows you to move 
                  the outer edge of your selection in and out in the tangent plane. 
                  Notice how all outer edges move at the same distance. Tangent 
                  and Normal Transform in conjunction with extrudes is a very 
                  power full tool for solving a number of technical modeling problems.

                <P> In Loq Airou you do not draw surfaces but rather edges that 
                  create surfaces when connected. Any edges that forms a triangle 
                  or quad will create a surface. When a polygon is created it 
                  will be turned in the same direction as its neighboring polygons. 
                  If there are no neighboring polygons it will be created facing 
                  the camera. If the neighboring polygons are facing different 
                  directions the modeler will create the polygon facing the direction 
                  of the majority of the neighbors (or towards the camera if there 
                  is tie). When a polygon is created it will delete neighboring 
                  polygons facing the wrong direction or polygons that break the 
                  two polygons per edge rule. This takes some time to get used 
                  to but turns out to be fairly intuitive. It is recommended that 
                  you as a user only use this creation tool to begin with until 
                  you are comfortable using it. </P>

                <P> By clicking and dragging with the left mouse button you 
                  can create an edge. Both ends can be snapped to existing geometry 
                  to make connected edges. The edges are by default created in 
                  the view plane, perpendicular to your view point, the depth 
                  is depending on the last drawn point. However when you draw you 
                  can see three lines representing X, Y And Z and by drawing close 
                  to them you can draw in a specific dimensions and not just in 
                  the view plane. </P>
                <P> If you which to draw in a plane perpendicular or one of the 
                  three axis (x/y, y/z or x/z) you can do by placing the camera 
                  in roughly one of the 3 axis. The software will then snap the 
                  drawing plane to the closest axis. </P>
<P>
Note: at this time there is no indication to when the view is directed close
 enough to axis for the snap to be active, this will be addressed in future versions.
</P>

                <P> To create a continuous line consisting of multiple edges you 
                  can tap the middle mouse button while creating an edge to leave 
                  off vertexes. </P>

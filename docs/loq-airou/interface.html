<P>
The interface has been designed to be fast and very productive. Rather
then building a standard interface we have opted to write a specialized
interface to be optimal for this task. This may mean that it may take
longer to learn, but once you have learned it you will be able to be 
very productive and make up for that time. The early intention of the
development was to be able to fit the entire interface in to a 3 button
mouse making it possible to use it with only one hand. So far this has 
been possible and this makes it possible to do other things with your 
other hand like holding a drink or someone you like.
</P>
                <P> Another important feature is that you do not need to tell 
                  the software what you are going to do by pressing any buttons 
                  selecting a tool or mode - you simply just do it. </P>
<TD><TD VALIGN = "TOP" WIDTH="30%">
                <P> This however means that where and how you click makes a big 
                  difference since the software interprets it differently. 
                  Therefore the application will give you hints to help you understand 
                  what the application is going to do. </P>
                <P> To avoid modalities we use the mouse buttons in combinations. 
                  The first mouse button you press will decide what you are going 
                  to do and if while holding it down press one of the other mouse 
                  buttons this action will modify the way you are performing the 
                  task. </P>
                <P> The Left mouse button is the main mouse button used for modeling. 
                  The Right mouse button is used for changing the view point. 
                  The Middle mouse button is used for pop-up menus. Different 
                  popup menus appear depending on what you are pointing to when 
                  pressing the popup menu. </P>
                <P> This means that Loq Airou requires an input device with 3 
                  mouse buttons that can be pressed in combination. </P>
<TD><TD VALIGN = "TOP" WIDTH="30%">
                <P> If you are using a mouse with fewer buttons or an input device 
                  where it may not be possible to press multiple mouse buttons 
                  at once you may use Shift-Ctrl-Alt to modify the mouse button 
                  in to the other mouse buttons. Then you can use Shift-Ctrl-Alt 
                  to press multiple mouse buttons. </P>
                <P>
Note: If you have a 2 mouse button plus wheel mouse pressing the wheel
will act as the middle mouse button.
</P>
                <P> We believe in building workflow for the user, the user should 
                  come into an environment that is so perfect that it makes them 
                  more creative and more productive. The tool should not be visible, 
                  the art should be. Time should be spent rearranging art, not 
                  the application. </P>
                <P> The things we build doesn't look like others, in every moment 
                  we try to be rebels, changing, challenging, disputing and hopefully 
                  one day revolutionizing.
